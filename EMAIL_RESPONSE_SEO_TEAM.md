**Subject:** Blog Editor Setup - WYSIWYG Ready + Video Walkthrough

---

Hi Nick,

Thanks for asking for clarity on the blog setup. Great questions.

## Quick Answers

**Do you have a WYSIWYG editor?**
Not exactly WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get), but it's **simple and straightforward**. We use **Markdown** formatting, which is way easier than HTML:
- `**bold**` for bold
- `# Heading` for headings  
- `- bullet` for lists
- `[link text](url)` for links

It's the same format used by Slack, Discord, Reddit, and most modern platforms. Takes about 2 minutes to learn.

**All Required Fields Included:**
✅ Title  
✅ SEO / Meta Title (≤60 characters)  
✅ Meta Description (≤160 characters)  
✅ Blog Content (with Markdown formatting)  
✅ Plus: Cover image, category, tags, publish status

## How to Get Started

1. **Access the Editor:** `https://thewildlandfirerecoveryfund.org/blog/editor` (we'll provide production link)
2. **Login:** Magic link via email (no password)
3. **Fill in fields:** Title, content, SEO metadata
4. **Publish:** One click and it's live

## Resources I'm Sending

I've prepared two documents:

1. **SEO_BLOG_EDITOR_GUIDE.md** - Full written guide with examples, Markdown cheat sheet, best practices
2. **BLOG_EDITOR_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md** - Video walkthrough script (~5-7 min) if you'd prefer a visual demo

You can choose:
- **Option A:** Read the guide, start uploading articles  
- **Option B:** I record a video walkthrough, you review, then start uploading  
- **Option C:** Quick Zoom call (10 min) to show you live, then you're ready to go

I'd recommend Option B (video) since you mentioned it would work better for you. I can have that recorded in the next day or two.

## Next Steps

Let me know which approach works best:
1. Send guide + start immediately?
2. Wait for video walkthrough?
3. Quick Zoom instead?

Once you decide, I'll get your email added to the authorized editors list and send the production link.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this!

Best,  
Earl
