When the flames finally die down and the news cameras move on, many people believe the worst is over. But for families, firefighters, and children impacted by wildfires, **the hardest part often begins after the fire is gone**.

Wildfire recovery is not a moment—it's a long, complex journey that can take years. And for too many communities, that journey happens quietly, without enough support, visibility, or resources.

## The Hidden Reality After a Wildfire

Wildfires destroy more than homes. They dismantle routines, livelihoods, mental health, and a sense of safety.

Survivors often face:

- Months or years of displacement
- Delayed or denied insurance claims
- Financial strain from lost wages and rebuilding costs
- Emotional trauma, grief, and survivor's guilt
- Long-term health effects from smoke exposure

For children, the impact can be even more severe—disrupted schooling, anxiety, sleep disorders, and lasting emotional scars.

Yet once the emergency phase ends, **most funding and attention disappears**.

## Why Emergency Relief Isn't Enough

Emergency aid is critical—but it's only the first step.

**Short term relief typically covers:**

- Evacuations
- Temporary shelter
- Immediate food and supplies

**What it doesn't cover:**

- Long-term housing stability
- Mental health care
- Child-focused recovery services
- Financial gaps while families rebuild
- Ongoing support for firefighters and first responders

This gap between emergency response and long term recovery is where many families fall through the cracks.

## What Long Term Wildfire Recovery Really Looks Like

True recovery means standing with communities long after the smoke clears.

It looks like:

- **Direct financial assistance** for families navigating rebuilding
- **Mental health and trauma-informed support**, especially for children
- **Support for firefighters and first responders** facing burnout, injury, and PTSD
- **Community rebuilding efforts** that restore dignity and stability
- **Sustained advocacy** to ensure no one is forgotten

Recovery is not about charity—it's about **continuity, dignity, and resilience**.

## Why We Exist

The Wildland Fire Recovery Fund was created to address what others overlook: **the long road after the fire**.

We focus on:

- Families who are months or years into recovery
- Children whose needs are often invisible
- Firefighters and first responders who give everything and are expected to move on without support

Our mission is simple but urgent: **to ensure recovery doesn't end when headlines do**.

## The Growing Need for Long Term Wildfire Support

Wildfires are increasing in frequency, size, and intensity. Communities are being asked to recover again and again—with fewer resources each time.

**Without sustained recovery efforts:**

- Families face permanent displacement
- Children carry unresolved trauma into adulthood
- First responders burn out and leave the profession
- Communities struggle to fully rebuild

Long term recovery is not optional—it's essential.

## How You Can Help Rebuild Lives After the Fire

Recovery is possible when people come together.

**You can help by:**

- Supporting organizations focused on long-term wildfire recovery
- Sharing stories that keep affected communities visible
- Advocating for sustained recovery funding
- Donating to ensure families, children, and firefighters aren't forgotten

Every act of support helps rebuild not just homes—but lives.

## Moving Forward, Together

Wildfires may be unavoidable. Abandoning communities afterward is not.

Recovery is about presence. About staying. About remembering.

At The Wildland Fire Recovery Fund, we are committed to walking alongside those impacted—**for as long as it takes**.

Because rebuilding after the fire isn't just about structures. It's about people.
