## Purpose
This script is for a **short walkthrough video** showing the SEO team how to use your blog editor. Total runtime: 5-7 minutes.

---

## Video Outline

### Intro (30 seconds)
"Hi Nick, thanks for asking for a walkthrough. I'll show you exactly how to upload and format articles on our blog platform. It's a straightforward process—no complicated backend setup needed."

---

### Section 1: Accessing the Editor (1 minute)

**Screen: Navigate to blog editor**

"First, you'll go to **yoursite.com/blog/editor** (or I can give you the production link).

You'll see a login screen. Just enter your email and we'll send you a magic link—no password needed.

Once you click the link in your email, you're in."

**Key point to mention:**
- Magic links last 24 hours
- They go to the email you provide
- Check spam folder if you don't see it

---

### Section 2: The Blog Editor Form (2 minutes)

**Screen: Show the full editor with all fields visible**

"Here's the editor. Let me walk you through each field:

#### Required Fields (marked with *)

**Title** - This is your main headline. It goes everywhere—the page, search results, social media.

**Slug** - This becomes the URL. So if the slug is `wildfire-recovery-story`, the URL is `/blog/wildfire-recovery-story`. 
We auto-generate it from the title, but you can customize it if needed.

**Content (Markdown)** - This is where the bulk of your article goes. We use Markdown for formatting, which is super simple. I'll show you how in a second.

#### Optional Fields

**Excerpt** - A brief summary (1-2 sentences) that shows in blog listings. If you don't fill this in, we'll auto-generate one.

**Cover Image URL** - The featured image. Just paste the full URL to an image. 
Example: `https://yoursite.com/public/Images/article-hero.webp`

---

### Section 3: SEO Fields (1.5 minutes)

**Screen: Highlight the SEO section (light gray box)**

"This is the critical part for SEO. These are the fields Google and other search engines actually see.

**SEO Title** (≤60 characters) - This is what shows up in Google search results as the clickable headline. 
You want this to be:
- Concise (50-60 characters max)
- Keyword-rich
- Compelling (make people want to click)

Example: `Eaton Fire Anniversary: Survivors Need Stronger Support`

**Meta Description** (≤160 characters) - This is the gray text under the title in search results. It should:
- Include your main keywords
- Be a compelling summary that encourages clicks
- Be 150-160 characters for best display

Example: `On the first anniversary of the Eaton Fire, survivors are still struggling to rebuild. Learn how community action and policy changes can support long-term wildfire recovery.`

The character counters help you stay within limits."

---

### Section 4: Formatting with Markdown (1.5 minutes)

**Screen: Show markdown examples in a separate example**

"Content is written in Markdown. Don't worry—it's way simpler than HTML. Here are the basics:

**Headings:**
```markdown
# Main Title
## Section Header
### Subsection
```

**Text formatting:**
- `**bold text**` for emphasis
- `*italic text*` 
- Links: `[Click here](https://example.com)`

**Lists:**
```markdown
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

1. Numbered item
2. Next item
```

**Images:**
```markdown
![Description of image](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

**Blockquotes (for quotes or key points):**
```markdown
> This is an important quote from a survivor
```

That's 90% of what you'll need. It's really straightforward."

---

### Section 5: Category, Tags & Publishing Options (1 minute)

**Screen: Show bottom section of form**

"Below the content, you'll choose:

**Category** - We have predefined categories. Pick the relevant one.

**Tags** (comma-separated) - Multiple keywords for the post. Example: `wildfire, recovery, Altadena, California, community`

**Publish Immediately** - Check this box to go live right away. Leave it unchecked to save as a draft and publish later.

**Featured Post** - Check this if you want it highlighted on the homepage/blog index."

---

### Section 6: Saving & Seeing Your Article (1 minute)

**Screen: Click Save Post button**

"Hit the 'Save Post' button. 

If everything's good, you'll see a success message: 'Post saved successfully! Post is now live.'

If there's an error (usually a missing field or slug already taken), it'll tell you exactly what to fix.

Once it's published, it goes live on the blog immediately. The post will appear in your blog feed, and Google will start indexing it within hours."

**Show the live article on the blog page:**

"Here it is live on the blog. The title, featured image, content—all formatted perfectly. SEO title and meta description are working in the background (you'll see them in Google search results in 24-48 hours)."

---

### Outro (30 seconds)

"That's really it. 

The workflow is:
1. Go to `/blog/editor`
2. Fill in the fields
3. Format your content in simple Markdown
4. Fill in SEO title & description
5. Click Save
6. Done!

If you run into any issues or questions, just reach out. We're here to help."
