        <p class="lede-content">
          The first anniversary of the devastating Eaton Fire in Altadena is a stark reminder that wildfire recovery is not a one-year journey—it’s a long, complex path that many survivors are still navigating today. Despite heroic community efforts, persistent barriers stand in the way of real recovery for those who lost homes, stability, and loved ones.

      <h2>The Ongoing Struggle for Fire Survivors</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Delayed insurance payouts</strong> have stranded families in limbo, unable to rebuild or return home.</li>
        <li>Many fire victims remain <strong>at risk of homelessness</strong>, shuffling between temporary housing options—some as many as 10 to 15 times.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal and state resources</strong> have not matched the scale of the community’s need, leaving critical gaps for thousands of families.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        “Whether a family is able to get back home or is displaced permanently comes down to one thing: Money.”

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zaire Calvin’s</strong> family, lifelong residents of Altadena, still mourns the loss of his sister—and now faces eviction instead of healing.</li>
        <li><strong>Ada Hernandez</strong> and her family, including two small children, still have no permanent housing a year after losing their home.</li>
        <li>Survivors like <strong>Casty Fortich</strong> rely on flexible employers and donated essentials, demonstrating both the resilience and the precariousness of fire-impacted families.</li>

      <h2>Recovery Barriers: Beyond the Flames</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nonprofits, disaster relief programs, and the SBA have become lifelines, but their hours and resources often fall short for working families.</li>
        <li>Survivor stories reveal a broken system: recovery paperwork, insurance negotiations, and basic survival tasks are hard to juggle when there’s nowhere certain to sleep.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        “How can someone complete paperwork, think of rebuilding, take care of their children, and hold down a job when they don’t even know where they’re going to sleep tonight?”
      </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Call for Action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fairness and accountability</strong> in insurance practices</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted federal disaster relief</strong> to meet actual needs</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing local and state support</strong> for long-term recovery</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        “The scale of needs dwarves the resources the county and state have already provided.”
      </blockquote>
